# Android Platform

After developing the application, we need to prepare our computer for developing and deploying the application to Android mobile devices.
`https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/deploying/` document contains all the instructions to deploy ionic to the device and `https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/8.x/guide/platforms/android/index.html` document contains all instructions 
 to prepare our computer for Android Development.
 
 ## Configure, build and Deploy to an Android Emulator
 Run `ionic cordova platform add android` to add android platform, <br> 
 `ionic cordova build android` to build app for android platform and<br>
 `ionic cordova emulate android` to deploy the app to the android emulator.
